ProductAssistant is a Python-based application that leverages Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI for image recognition to identify products from user-uploaded images. It then fetches relevant product data from Amazon using the Real-Time Amazon Data API via RapidAPI, stores the data in Google BigQuery for further analysis, and provides interactive visualizations using Looker Studio. Additionally, the project integrates a chatbot to help users filter and query product information dynamically.
